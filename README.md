Performing analaysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends

## Overview of Project
  Louise wants to know how other fundraising campaigns for Plays and Theaters compare to her play Fever. She was able to fund her campaign fairly quickly and she wants to see how other campaigns around the world have performed. We will dig into different outcomes based off how successful other projects have been in relation their funding goals and the launch dates. This will give Louise an idea of how her play compared to others.
### Purpose
TThis project is a visualization and an analysis of the Kickstarter data set. The purpose of this analysis is to see how Louise’s play Fever compares to funding for all of the other plays and theater sub categories across the world. We want to see if the goal amounts and month of launch date play a significate roll on whether the campaign meets its funding goals or not. 

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
  We are analyzing The Theater outcomes by the day they were set to Launch. The line chart shows that the highest month for successful funding campaigns is in May. The chart started trending up in April and started slowing down towards the end of the summer months. 
The failed campaigns were consistent throughout the year. They averaged about 41 failed campaigns per month which is accurately represented by looking at the blue line for ‘failed’. There were not many cancellations throughout the year.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
  We are analyzing the Percentage of successful fundraising goals met depending on their goal amounts. By looking at the chart titled ‘Outcome Based on Goal’ we can gather that the lower the goal amount the higher the percentage of success the campaigns have. Campaigns that have goals under $5,000 had a success rate of over 70%. As the Goal amount increased the there was a decline in successful funding goals. The successful campaigns dropped to 20% from $25,000 - $29,999 and then increased to a success rate of to 67% for goal amounts $35,000 - $44,999. 

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
	When analyzing the ‘Outcomes based on Launch Date’ it is visible that May is the highest month and the summer months had higher successful outcomes but it doesnt show how this realtes to total volume for that month in comparison to the other months.
  A challenge encountered with only analyzing the charts for the 'Outcomes Based off Goals' was that the visual does not show the quantity of projects being analyzed. The highest success rates are with goals below $5,000 but there is also there is an increase in success rates from $35k to $44k. The chart does not show that majority of the volume of the campaigns are in the lower goal amounts, 69% of the total projects are under $5,000 or less and less than 1% of the projects are in the $35k to $45k range. This does not give us a proper analysis because the chart can be misleading and show that high goals can lead to higher results even though that is not the case.
Another challenge with this data is that the currency used for these goals are not consistent so it may not be accurate to analyze based off different currencies unless they are all converted to the same one.


## Results
My conclusions from the ‘Outcomes based on Launch Date’ is that there are more projects in the summer months May-August. The failed outcomes stay consistent throughout the year ranging between 33 and 52 projects but the successful projects range from 37 to 111. I think this graph can be misleading because it doesn’t compare the total volume from each month. For the chart ’Outcomes based on Goals’ I concluded that the highest success rates are for projects with goals less than $5,000 but there is an increase in success rate from $35k-$45k. This is also a misleading chart because is does not show the volume of projects just the success rate and goal amount.

The data set for both of the charts had some limitations. When analyzing the ‘Outcomes based on Launch Date’ Chart it is visible that May is the highest month and the summer months had higher successful outcomes. The chart shows the volume which means that there are more Projects in general during those months but it does not show the correlation of the success rates for these months. A challenge encountered with only analyzing the charts for the ‘Outcomes Based off Goals’ was that the visual does not show the quantity of projects being analyzed. The highest success rates are with goals below $5,000 but there is also there is an increase in success rates from $35k to $44k. The chart does not show that majority of the volume of the campaigns are in the lower goal amounts, 69% of the total projects are under $5,000 or less and less than 1% of the projects are in the $35k to $44k range. This does not give us a proper analysis because the chart can be misleading and show that high goals can lead to higher results even though that is not the case.

I would recommend this data be represented with different types of charts. The ‘Outcomes based on Launch Date’ would work with a stacked bar graph because it would be a better comparison for total volume month over month and how that affected how many successful outcomes there were. The ‘Outcomes Based off Goals’ would have been better represented with a box and whiskers chart showing successful, failed, and cancelled in their own box with the goal amount in the Y-axis. This would show that the data was skewed and that majority of the projects were in the lower end of the goals.
